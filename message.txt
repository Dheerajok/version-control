In this project, I gained hands-on experience with Git version control by creating and managing repositories both locally and on GitHub. I performed essential Git operations, including staging, committing, branching, and merging, to manage code efficiently. This project allowed me to understand how to collaborate with others effectively by leveraging Git and GitHub. By the end of the process, I developed a clear understanding of version control best practices and how to manage code collaboratively in a streamlined and organized manner.
